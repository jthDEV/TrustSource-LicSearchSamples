# TrustSource-LicSearchSamples

This repository contains different use cases to simulate the distribution of license information. When researching for license conditions, the researcher often has a magnitude of issues: Licenses that claim to be type A but actually are type B or they may contain additional clauses. Also it may happen that a main component is of license A but a linked or subcomponent is of type C or E, not in compliance with license A, etc.

To support a safe and secure resolution of these issues, this data is aimed to provide test data, simulating all kind of strange situations found in real world scenarios.

You are invited to add strange cases. Please create your own folder for your cases and leave a short discription describing the case as well as the good and bad conditions.
Thank you
